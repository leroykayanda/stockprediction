stockprediction
===============

This is neural network based stock prediction application written in PHP

A neural network is created and trained using backpropagation and simulated annealing algorithms to predict future stock prices.

Feedforward

This folder contains generic classes required to create a neural network and train it.

Prediction

This folder used the generic classes in Feedforward folder to create and train a neural network to predict stocks

Matrix

Contains classes to create and manipulate matrices, which are very important in neural networks.


This program does not require a database to work. Data is read from CSV files at run time using the CSVReader class. Therefore the program should work straight from the box once the project has been uploaded on a server
